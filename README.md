==================================

[C. Conti](https://github.com/nonlinearxwaves)

QuSoliton is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of quantum solitons.
QuSoliton uses Numpy, Cupy packages as numerical backend, and graphical output is provided by Matplotlib.
QuSoliton is based on the positive P-representation and include nonlocal solitons
QuSoliton is freely available for use and/or modification, and it can be used on all Unix-based platforms and on Windows.
Being free of any licensing fees, QuSoliton is ideal for exploring classical and quantum soliton dynamics for students and researchers.
